PROJECT: Make a game that I can sell on Steam
	- Is 2D
	- Must include Multiplayer
	- Uses Godot or Electron ideally I haven't really decided yet
	- Similar playstyle to Super Auto Pets

Inspiration:
	Egg Inc.
	Brawlhalla
	Super Auto Pets ********
	The Expendabros
	Terraria
	Pac-Man
	Among Us
	Mario
	Souls Games (RPG)
	Soul Knight
	Agar.io
	Crossy road
	Geometry Dash
	Ultimate Chicken Horse
	Hearthstone
	Explosive Kittens
	Shotgun King
	Magic Survival
	Chess Boxing The Videogame (Chess for 30 seconds then Street Fighter for 30 seconds) ****************
	Alto's Adventure but Space Themed

What I want:
	2D
	Multiplayer available (but also playable offline)
		1v1 format
	Autochess or Satisfying idle game or Roguelike with loads of unique weapons
	Simple graphics

Game Idea: Rouguelike Dungeon-crawler
	For singleplayer mode: roguelike dungeon run with 5 randomly selected bosses that you have to beat to complete the game 

Game Idea: Space Game
	Fly a spaceship through an asteroid cluttered space to land on a planet, where it becomes a timer-based survival game like Soul Knight + Magic Survival where, when you reach the timer, spaceship is ready and you can move on to the next planet
		Any powerups/weapons received are kept throughout the game, planets get harder and harder as time passes
	Includes an Endless Arcade Mode, where you start with nothing and goal is to reach the highest possible score and mobs get tougher as time passes. Weapons/powerups will get better as time passes too

Game Idea: Chess boxing
	1v1 where you play 30sec Chess, then 30sec Street Fighter over and over until one player wins either one of the games
	Will need AI so players don't have to play against real players
	Friends System
